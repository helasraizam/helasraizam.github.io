<ul>
<li><i>Cosmology</i> is the study of the universe.</li>
<li>The <i>Universe</i> is everything.</li>
<li>The <i>observable universe</i> is everything that can be observed from Earth that light has had time to reach us from.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>As discussed in Ch. 26, the universe is expanding.</li>
<li>In his theory of general relativity, Einstein found that the universe must either be expanding or contracting.</li>
<li>In what he called his "greatest blunder", Einstein added the <i>cosmological constant</i>, which modified the equations to allow a static universe.</li>
<li>Russian mathematician Friedmann found this to be an unstable equilibrium, and Hubble's study showed the universe to be expanding indeed!</li>
<li>Einstein's theory of general relativity shows that even an infinite universe can't be constant.</li>
<li>Recent observations suggest the rate of expansion may be accelerating.</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-sec-org00cf1f7">
<h4 id="org00cf1f7">The Hubble Time</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the universe is presently expanding, it's posited to have come from a hot dense point which exploded in what's called the <i>Big Bang</i> at the beginning of time.</li>
<li>By measuring the rate of expansion and moving backwards, we can find an age for the universe using the familiar equation</li>

</ul>
<p>
\[v=d/t\]
where <i>v</i> is velocity, <i>d</i> distance, and <i>t</i> time, assuming (or approximating with) constant velocity.
</p>
<ul>
<li>As discussed in Ch. 26, a galaxy's distance and its velocity in the expanding universe are related by</li>

</ul>
<p>
\[v=Hd\]
</p>

<section >
<p>
where H<sub>o</sub> is the Hubble constant.
</p>
<ul>
<li>So the age of the universe T<sub>0</sub>&#x2014;known as the Hubble time&#x2014;is given by</li>

</ul>
<p>
\[T_o=\frac{d}{v}=\frac{d}{H_{o}d}=\frac{1}{H_o}.\]
</p>
<ul>
<li>With H<sub>o</sub>=21 km/s/MLy, T<sub>o</sub>&asymp;14 billion years, with 5% uncertainty.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org294e4f7">
<h4 id="org294e4f7">A Universal Acceleration</h4>
<ul>
<li>We expect the universe's expansion to slow down (decelerate) due to gravity.</li>
<li>For decades, astronomers couldn't observe this deceleration because they needed larger telescopes (to measure redshifts of farther galaxies) and a very bright <i>standard candle</i> with enough (known) luminosity to be observed from billions of light-years or more.</li>
<li>In the 1990s, Astronomers showed that Type Ia supernovae&#x2014;occuring when a white dwarf eats another star to exceed the Chandrasekhar to explode&#x2014;are very bright standard bulbs.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>The apparent brightness of the supernova can be calculated based on its distance from us, which can be inferred from the measured redshift.</li>
<li>In 1998, two groups of researchers found these supernovae to be dimmer than expected by these calculations!</li>
<li>Whereas if the universe were decelerating, we'd expect far-away supernovae to be brighter!</li>
<li>The natural first conclusion is that maybe supernovae aren't the reliable standard candles we think they are, or differed from the supernovae we're used to, or were made fainter by extra dust.</li>
<li>These were shown to be incorrect.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>This calls the Hubble constant into question; maybe the expansion of the Universe is accelerating!</li>
<li>Later observations support this theory.</li>
<li>But where does it get its energy, termed <i>dark energy</i>?</li>
<li>Like dark matter, dark energy has not been detected in Earthly laboratories.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Dark energy could be associated with emptiness, as Quantum Mechanics informs us that particles flicker in and out of existence everywhere, but QM calculations are off from the energy required for the acceleration of the Universe by 10<sup>120</sup>.</li>
<li>So while evidence for dark energy exists, its source is not fully known.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>The theory is that after the big bang, the expansion was slowest because gravity was strongest, then it decelerated, then dark energy took over.</li>

</ul>

<section >
<ul>
<li>That means expansion isn't constant, so the result T<sub>o</sub>=1/H<sub>0</sub> isn't valid.</li>
<li>By coincidence, however, the amount of expansion and contraction cancel; T<sub>o</sub>=13.8 Gy&asymp;1/H<sub>o</sub>.</li>
<li>So the Hubble expansion constant changes with time, and the measured value of H<sub>o</sub> is for the present expansion.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="org34715bf">Comparing Ages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recall that globular clusters can be dated using models of stellar evolution; the oldest stars are measured to have formed about 12-13 billion years ago.</li>
<li>This is confirmed by radioactive dating, using the spectrum of stars and their relative U-238 abundance.</li>

<h4 id="org5d3d479">The Expanding Universe</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Cosmological Principle</i> (see Ch 28) states that the universe is homogeneous (same average makeup in all space) and isotropic (same average makeup in all directions).</li>
<li>The expansion of the universe causes light to redshift as well, according to how much the space has stretched during its journey.</li>
<li>We denote the scale factor of the expansion by R for two given times; so if the scale has doubled, R=2.</li>

<h4 id="org5242596">Models of the Expansion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Putting aside dark energy and the amount of mass in the universe, we have four models for how the universe might evolve.</li>

</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>To analyze which model is right, astronomers observe the <i>average density</i> of the universe (accounting for mass as energy's equivalent mass).</li>
<li>A low average density will will cause negligible deceleration so that the universe effectively expands forever.</li>
<li>A higher density means higher gravity, so that the expansion stops eventually.</li>
<li>A very high density could even cause the universe to collapse again.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>We can calculate a <i>critical density</i> for which the universe will expand forever, but any higher density would stop after some time, and compare this to the calculated density.  If the calculated density is higher, then we can conclude that gravity will eventually stop and reverse the expansion of the universe.</li>
