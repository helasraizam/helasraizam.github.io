<ul>
<li><i>Radiation</i> in our context is light, which radiates outwards&#x2014;though in other contexts it describes subatomic particles released in atomic processes.</li>
<li>Our radiation (light, in this course) is also generated at the atomic level.</li>

<h4 id="org1c8155b">Maxwell's Theory of Electromagnetism</h4>
<ul>
<li>Each atom is made up of protons (positive charge), neutrons (no charge), and electrons (negative charge).</li>
<li>The neutrons and protons are in a tiny nucleus, while the electron is generally around it.</li>
<li>Electricity and Magnetism - electric force is due to stationary charged particles interacting, while magnetic force is due to moving charged particles interacting (among other things).</li>

</ul>
</section>
<ul>
<li>We can talk about the field that a charged distribution exerts as a generalization of its force on multiple objects; like the gravitational field, we call these the electric or magnetic fields; each can create the other.</li>

<li><i>Wien's Law</i>: The higher the temperature, the shorter the peak energy wavelength. \[\lambda_{max}=\frac{(3\times10^6 nm\cdot{}K)}{T}.\]</li>

<ul>
<li>The sun's light was put through a spectrometer in 1802 by William Wollaston; he noticed that some frequencies were not present (they were black where the color would appear).</li>
<li>Researchers found the same is true of light that passes through a gas of some element.</li>
<li>That means the gas is <i>not</i> transparent to some wavelengths&#x2014;it lets most colors through, but not some specific set of colors.  Combining two gases would subtract both their sets of colors from the resulting spectrum, each element having its specific spectrum.</li>

An <i>absorption spectrum</i> is a series of black lines in an otherwise continuous spectrum, which gives information about what wavelengths are <i>absorbed</i> by a material.  The <i>emission spectrum</i> is the opposite, it's what wavelengths are emitted by the material when it's excited.</li>

<li>If the correct amount of energy is supplied, the electron can jump to a higher energy level.  The electron can also jump down to a lower energy level, releasing energy in the form of light.</li>

<h4 id="org9bff29e">Looking for Patterns</h4>
<ul>
<li>Planets orbit the Sun (and, mostly, themselves) counter-clockwise, and the Sun orbits itself counter-clockwise, evidence that the Sun and planets may have formed from a spinning cloud of gas and dust called the <i>solar nebula</i>.</li>
<li>Sun, Jupiter and Saturn have similar compositions, evidence they may have been formed from the same material reservoir.</li>
<li>Terrestrial planets have less of these materials, since at their temperature so close to the Sun the materials would evaporate (whereas they're liquid/ice/gas in the vicinity of the giant planets).</li>

<h4 id="orgcde36b6">The Evidence from Far Away</h4>
<ul>
<li>We can compare this present data to star systems far away that are in varying stages of formations like that of the solar system to get a good picture of the birth of the solar system.</li>
<li>The name for solar nebulas (the cloud posited to birth the solar system) outside of the solar system is <i>circumstellar disks</i>.</li>

<h4 id="orga99d06f">Building Planets</h4>
<ul>
<li>As planets form from circumstellar disks common around young stars, we begin to see <i>planetesimals</i>&#x2014;planet foetuses.  Computer simulations with Physics laws taken into account support these theories.</li>
<li>Still leaves the questions; why do Uranus and Pluto spin on their sides, why does Venus spin slowly around itself retroactively?  These could be the results of early collisions.</li>
