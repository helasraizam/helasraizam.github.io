<ul>
<li><i>Radiation</i> in our context is light, which radiates outwards&#x2014;though in other contexts it describes subatomic particles released in atomic processes.</li>
<li>Our radiation (light, in this course) is also generated at the atomic level.</li>

<h4 id="org5968e71">Maxwell's Theory of Electromagnetism</h4>
<ul>
<li>Each atom is made up of protons (positive charge), neutrons (no charge), and electrons (negative charge).</li>
<li>The neutrons and protons are in a tiny nucleus, while the electron is generally around it.</li>
<li>Electricity and Magnetism - electric force is due to stationary charged particles interacting, while magnetic force is due to moving charged particles interacting (among other things).</li>

<ul>
<li>We can talk about the field that a charged distribution exerts as a generalization of its force on multiple objects; like the gravitational field, we call these the electric or magnetic fields; each can create the other.</li>

<li><i>Wien's Law</i>: The higher the temperature, the shorter the peak energy wavelength. \[\lambda_{max}=\frac{(3\times10^6 nm\cdot{}K)}{T}.\]</li>

<h4 id="orgebbf99e">Properties of Light</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Reflection</i> is light "bouncing" off of a surface, like a mirror.</li>
<li><i>Refraction</i> is the bending of light by materials (eg, when light goes from one <i>medium</i>, or material, to another).</li>
<li><i>Optics</i> is the study of light; one optical instrument or tool is the telescope.</li>

<h4 id="orgfd55583">White light</h4>
<ul>
<li>White light, passed through a prism, results in a rainbow, because the refraction of light depends on the material as well as the frequency of light, in a phenomenon known as <i>dispersion</i> (the rays disperse).</li>
<li>This results in a spectrum; an instrument used to measure the spectrum is called a <i>spectrometer</i>.</li>

<h4 id="org17a6635">The Value of Stellar Spectra</h4>
<ul>
<li>The sun's light was put through a spectrometer in 1802 by William Wollaston; he noticed that some frequencies were not present (they were black where the color would appear).</li>
<li>Researchers found the same is true of light that passes through a gas of some element.</li>
<li>That means the gas is <i>not</i> transparent to some wavelengths&#x2014;it lets most colors through, but not some specific set of colors.  Combining two gases would subtract both their sets of colors from the resulting spectrum, each element having its specific spectrum.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Heated gases also emitted light in a particular set of small <i>bands</i>, or portions of frequencies, and these matched!  <b>Each element has its signature spectrum!</b></li>

<h4 id="orgb5d68bf">Types of Spectra</h4>
<ul>
<li>A <i>continuous spectrum</i>, formed by a radiating dense gas or solid, is composed of all wavelengths of light.  An <i>absorption spectrum</i> is a series of black lines in an otherwise continuous spectrum, which gives information about what wavelengths are <i>absorbed</i> by a material.  The <i>emission spectrum</i> is the opposite, it's what wavelengths are emitted by the material when it's excited.</li>
<li>We can apply <i>spectral analysis</i> to help determine the material in a sample, or in light from a distant galaxy.</li>

<li>Niels Bohr solves the mystery of why electrons don't collapse into nucleus: quantized orbital radii.  Energy is only radiated or absorbed when an electron changes <i>energy levels</i>, energies corresponding to a certain orbital radius.  Strange, but lays foundations for Quantum Mechanics.</li>
<li>If the correct amount of energy is supplied, the electron can jump to a higher energy level.  The electron can also jump down to a lower energy level, releasing energy in the form of light.</li>

<ul>
<li>A telescope <i>collects</i> light from a source, and <i>focuses</i> it into a point or image.</li>
<li>Collecting can be done with a lens or curved mirror.</li>
<li>Telescope light-gathering power is compared with <i>apertures</i>; diameters of the telescope opening.</li>
<li>How much more light can a telescope with twice the aperture collect?</li>
<li>Can use an additional lens, the <i>eyepiece</i>, to magnify the image.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org8b16b2d">
<h4 id="org8b16b2d">Lenses</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lenses are typically curved glass that <i>refract</i>, or bend, light rays.  This example converges light towards the <i>focus</i> of the lens, a <i>focal length</i> away from its center.</li>

<ul>
<li>Light travels through a lens in refracting telescopes; imperfections anywhere in the lens or in the cut cause distortions.</li>
<li>Different frequencies travel differently in lenses (remember prisms?), leading to <i>chromatic aberration</i> in refracting telescopes.</li>
<li>Glass sags!</li>
<li>Reflecting telescopes avoid these problems with a concave <i>primary mirror</i>, for which only a single surface needs good manufacturing.</li>

<li>Mountains, far from light pollution is good.</li>
<li>Other factors include clear weather, atmospheric water vapor, air turbulence  (which leads to bad <i>seeing</i>).  We want low turbulence, stable air (like air that's flowed over water a long distance).</li>

<ul>
<li>Resolution refers to precision of detail in an image.</li>
<li>Resolution measured in arcseconds (how big a quarter would look, 5 km away!).</li>
<li>Good resolution can come from high aperture.</li>
<li>Resolution is weakened by gases of different temperature which act as lenses, distorting the image.  This is why the stars "twinkle"!</li>
<li>It's also why we have telescopes on satellites in space.</li>
<li>Another option is <i>adaptive optics</i>, where we undistort atmospheric distortion with a flexible mirror.</li>

<h4 id="orgbef114e">Radar Astronomy</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Radar</i> is bouncing radio waves off of objects in our solar system and analyzing the reflection.  Timing gives us the distance to, say, a mountain on Jupiter's surface.</li>
<li>Using the Doppler effect, radar observations can determine the speed of objects!</li>
<li>Best facility was 305-m telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in a bowl shape with hills, wherein the detector is moved.  Now surpassed by Five-hundred-meter Aperture Radio Telescope (FAST) in Pingtang Cty, China, which moves plates in the dish to focus on different objects.</li>

<li>Water vapor is the main source of atmospheric interference, and it's concentrated in the lower part of Earth's atmosphere.  Even 100 m elevation helps!</li>
<li>Airplane observations have been made since 1960s, and are still being made.</li>

<ul>
<li>Named for Edwin Hubble, who discovered the expansion of the universe in the 1920s (more on that later).</li>
<li>Mirror so precise that if it were scaled to the size of the entire continental US, there would be no hill or valley larger than ~6 cm.</li>
<li>Scientists saved money by not testing it before launch.</li>

<ul>
<li>Turns out the mirror's <i>shape</i> was off by the width of a human hair, enough to make things blurry.</li>
<li>December 1993, astronauts captured the orbiting telescope and fixed it (even put a new camera on!).</li>
<li>The HST has been upgraded and repaired multiple times since.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mirrors are harder for X- and &gamma;- (gamma-)rays, which go through matter, but this is rectified in satellites (somehow).</li>
<li>Gamma-ray detection can be done indirectly by observing byproducts of their collisions with charged particles on Earth.</li>

<ul>
<li>Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST, 2021): Telescope with large field of view, scans sky for <i>transients</i> or events that happen quickly, such as exploding stars.</li>
<li>Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA, 2021-2025): Measures gamma rays from ground.</li>
<li>Others working on larger-mirror telescopes (a third the size of a football field, composed of smaller mirrors).</li>
