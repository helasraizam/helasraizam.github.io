<ul>
<li>Distances initially had to do with the human body:
<ol>
<li>The inch is the approximate distance between knuckles</li>
<li>The yard is the span from the extended finger to the nose of the British king (??)</li>
<li>Foot is the British king's foot</li>
<li>Different countries had different measures.</li>

<li>Around 1750, a uniform set of standards was made</li>

<h4 id="orgbb3edd1">The Metric System</h4>
<ul>
<li>The metric system is the SI units we've been studying, and has the meter as the unit of length.</li>
<li>This includes prefixes like centi-, mili-, kilo-, etc.</li>

<h4 id="orgd407bfd">Modern Redefinitions of the Meter</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 1889, the meter was defined by a bar of platinum-iridium metal in Paris, of which precise replicas were made.</li>
<li>As science gets more and more precise, so do the definitions of these distances.</li>
<li>In 1960, a meter is defined as the distance of 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of a specific atomic transition of krypton-86.</li>
<li>In 1983, a meter is defined in terms of the speed of light, as the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458.6 seconds, which is even more stable.</li>
<li>Therefore, a light-second is defined as the <i>distance</i> that light travels in one second, 299,792,458.6 meters.</li>

<li>Some distances can be directly calculated from radar measurements, using the known speed of light.</li>
<li>The basic unit of distance for objects within the solar system is the astronomical unit (AU), the (average) distance between the Earth and the Sun; 1 AU = 1.5&times;10<sup>11</sup> m=500 light-seconds.</li>

<li>We can measure their periods with the doppler shift of the expanding/contracting surface, or with the change in overall color (due to temperature change), or with the changing luminosity, which is most important.</li>

<li>Turns out the period is related to the absolute luminosity; this is known as the <i>period-luminosity relation,</i> discovered in 1908 by Henrietta Leavitt of Harvard.  This is huge, because we can figure out how far away the cepheid is by comparing the apparent magnitude (flux) that we observe to the absolute luminosity!</li>

<li>The step between dust compressing and the youngest star is difficult to observe, because (1) it's very short (thousands of years, making it sparse), and (2) it's literally as dusty as you can get without being a star, so that it absorbs a lot of visible light.</li>
