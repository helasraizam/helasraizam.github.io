<li>Day is based on Earth's spin&#x2014;defined as 1.0000 solar day.</li>
<li>Month is length of full lunar cycle&#x2014;29.5306 days.</li>

<ul>
<li>Stonehenge (built over three periods, 2800-1500 BCE) concentric series of stones and ditches&#x2014;some aligned with Sun and Moon during critical rising and setting periods (such Summer and Winter solstices).</li>
<li>Mayans had a complex calendar which could predict Astronomical events through an observatory.</li>
<li>Ancient Chinese calendar centered around 12-year Jupiter cycle&#x2014;these are the 12 year signs of the Zodiac, which correspond to Jupiter's position along the Zodiac.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Our calendar derives from the Sumerians, continuing with Egyptians and Greeks, leading to Ceasar's <i>Julian Calendar</i>, at 365.25 days/year, using leap years (with one extra day, 2/29) every four years (years divisible by 4).</li>
<li>The Islamic Calendar is still lunar.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="org3ea531a">The Gregorian Calendar</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pope Gregory XIII corrected the 11 minutes/year that the Julian calendar was off&#x2014;off enough that the calendar was 10 days off by 1852.</li>
<li>October 4, 1582, 10 days were immediately skipped in the calendar (to get back on track).  Like Julian calendar, every four years is a leap year&#x2014;except on centuries not divisible by 4 (e.g., 1700, 1800, 1900).  The year 2000 was a leap year, but not the year 1900.</li>
<li>Catholic countries followed suit, other countries later&#x2014;American colonies skipped from September 2, 1752 to September 14, 1752 (12 days!).  Russia had to omit 13 days by the time it adopted the calendar during the Bolshevik revolution.</li>

<h4 id="orgd5861bb">Types of Spectra</h4>
<ul>
<li>A <i>continuous spectrum</i>, formed by a radiating dense gas or solid, is composed of all wavelengths of light.  An <i>absorption spectrum</i> is a series of black lines in an otherwise continuous spectrum, which gives information about what wavelengths are <i>absorbed</i> by a material.  The <i>emission spectrum</i> is the opposite, it's what wavelengths are emitted by the material when it's excited.</li>
<li>We can apply <i>spectral analysis</i> to help determine the material in a sample, or in light from a distant galaxy.</li>

<h3 id="org0f03a6a">The Structure of the Atom</h3>
<ul>
<li>What's an atom made of?</li>
<li>In their natural state, atoms are electrically neutral.</li>
<li><i>Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment</i> hit gold with &alpha; particles&#x2014;He<sup>2+</sup>&#x2014;some bounced; "as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you."</li>
<li>Conclusion: nearly all mass is contained in a tight nucleus, the electrons are in motion (or they would go towards the protons).</li>

<h4 id="orgd3e69df">The Atomic Nucleus</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mass of proton is 2000 times that of electron, their charges are equal and opposite.</li>
<li>Electrons "orbit" about an average radius, different for each atom.</li>
<li>Elements are defined by the number of protons (1 for hydrogen, 2 for helium, etc.).</li>
<li><i>Isotopes</i> of an element have different numbers of neutrons.</li>

<h4 id="orgee787e6">The Bohr Atom</h4>
<ul>
<li>Niels Bohr solves the mystery of why electrons don't collapse into nucleus: quantized orbital radii.  Energy is only radiated or absorbed when an electron changes <i>energy levels</i>, energies corresponding to a certain orbital radius.  Strange, but lays foundations for Quantum Mechanics.</li>
<li>If the correct amount of energy is supplied, the electron can jump to a higher energy level.  The electron can also jump down to a lower energy level, releasing energy in the form of light.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>The energy that light carries is given by its frequency \(f\) in the relationship, \[E=hf,\] where \(h=6.626\times10^{-34}\) joule-seconds (J&sdot;s) is <i>Planck's constant</i>.</li>

<h3 id="org3fa5893">Formation of Spectral Lines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bohr's model can explain the spectral lines of different materials!</li>
<li>Based on orbital radii of atoms (based on their nuclear configuration), each atom can accept and emit a unique spectrum of light.</li>

<h4 id="org877104c">Energy Levels and Excitation</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Ground state</i> is the lowest radius that an electron can orbit the nucleus.</li>
<li><i>Excitation</i> is when an atom absorbs energy and goes to a higher energy level.  After excitation, it may relax back to its original state, releasing light.</li>

<h4 id="org6d17c08">Ionization</h4>
<ul>
<li>An atom is <i>ionized</i>, or turned into an <i>ion</i>, when enough energy is given to the electron to free it from the pull of the nucleus.</li>
<li>This changes the energy levels.</li>
