<h4 id="org432f1e6">Evolution from the Main Sequence to Red Giants</h4>
<ul>
<li>We've traced stellar evolution up to the main sequence.</li>
<li>The main sequence is where the star sustains itself through fusion.</li>
<li>It's referred to as the prolonged adolescence or adulthood stage of the star's life cycle.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<ul>
<li>Left edge of main sequence below is referred to as the <i>zero-age main sequence</i>, where stars first fuse hydrogen and settle in to the main sequence.</li>

</ul>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./Images/18_15.png" alt="18_15.png" />
</p>
</div>
</section>
<ul>
<li>While on main sequence, mass doesn't change much (only .7% of mass is converted to energy in fusion) but chemical composition goes from mostly Hydrogen to more and more Helium.</li>
<li>This change in composition changes the star's temperature, luminosity, size, and interior structure.</li>
<li>This moves it along the H-R diagram!  How?</li>
<li>As H converts to He through the nuclear pp-chain, the inner density increases, increasing temperature, giving protons more speed on average, resulting in more collisions, and a much higher rate of fusion.</li>
<li>The rate of fusion of the pp-cycle increases with temperature as</li>

</ul>
<p>
\[\mbox{Rate of pp-fusion}\propto{}T^4.\]
</p>
</section>
<ul>
<li>So temperature increases, and luminosity will increase due to the increased rate of fusion (which produces increased rate of energy).</li>
<li>This means up and to the left on the H-R diagram, but these changes are relatively small and most stars remains on the main sequence for most of their lives.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org8b06d65">
<h4 id="org8b06d65">Lifetimes on the Main Sequence</h4>
<ul>
<li>How long a star stays on the main sequence depends on how much fuel it starts with and how quickly it uses it up.</li>
<li>More massive stars use up fuel more quickly since they need greater inner temperatures to balance out the much higher pressures of outer layers, and the rate of fusion goes as T<sup>4</sup>.</li>
<li>On average, 90% of a star's life is spent on the main sequence.  This time depends on its mass.</li>
<li>Turns out a mass of .4 gives the star around 200 billion years on the main sequence, while a mass of 40 solar masses is a mere million years (Table 22.1).</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-orged1142e">
<h4 id="orged1142e">From Main-Sequence to Red Giant</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eventually, hydrogen in the core is depleted with helium in its place (and whatever heavier elements it had to start with).</li>
<li>The temperature for helium fusion is much higher, so that doesn't happen in these stars.</li>
<li>The star begins to shrink, and its brightness and heat comes from the conversion of gravitational into heat energy (as Kelvin and Helmholtz posited).</li>
<li>This process heats up the hydrogen that was just outside the core the whole time enough for it to undergo fusion, which in turns heats up layers outside of it, causing them to expand.</li>
<li>Meanwhile the helium core keeps contracting, giving out more heat, causing more fusion.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Most star burns brighter than it ever did in this stage, since the fusion is not confined to the core.</li>
<li>The increased heat causes the outer layers to expand, and the star's size increases ridiculously.</li>
<li>This increase in size results in a decrease in temperature.  So our star is now cooler (to the right H-R) but also more luminous (up on H-R).</li>
<li>As stars evolve, they become more red.</li>
<li>This stage represents the star's old age.</li>
<li>Remember that more massive stars go through every stage much faster.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>E.g., Betelgeuse is 10 million years old but is already a red supergiant (compared to the red star that is the 4.5 billion year-old Sun), because it's 16 times more massive.</li>

<h4 id="orgc04d90c">Helium Fusion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Let's focus on stars with initial low masses, about twice the solar mass (initial because the mass will change) and lower.</li>
<li>When gravity shrinks the star, the core temperature can reach higher temperatures than it had in its main-sequence days.</li>
<li>When it reaches 100 million K, it's hot enough for the <i>triple-alpha process</i> of fusion of three helium atoms into a single carbon nucleus.</li>
<li>All carbon on Earth was once made in a red giant!</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>The triple-alpha process requires three helium atoms&#x2014;each of which has double the protons and hence electric repulsion as hydrogen&#x2014;to collide together, simultaneously.</li>
<li>This is unlike the pp-chain in which only two particles collide at a time, making it a much more scarce reaction.</li>
<li>So it's understandable that the temperature needed, 100 million K, is much greater for this process.</li>
<li>In low-mass stars, this ignites the entire core in a fusion chain reaction called a <i>helium flash</i> (in higher-mass stars, it's not a flash, but a slower process).</li>
<li>The flash increases temperature, heating the core, in turn increasing nuclear fusion reactions in a runaway generation of energy!</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-orgb1a170f">
<h4 id="orgb1a170f">Becoming a Giant Again</h4>
<ul>
<li>The star comes to balance after the helium flash, now producing more energy at its core so that its surface temperature increases, but its overall luminosity decreases (left and downwards on H-R).</li>
<li>Sometimes, carbon will collid with helium to form oxygen.</li>
<li>This new stability feeding on the fusion of helium is short-lived because of the very fast rate of fusion, caused by the high temperature.</li>

<ul>
<li>After the helium is used up, the star's fusion is once again depleted, gravity takes over again, and it begins to shrink.</li>
<li>This again causes the core to heat up adjacent shells&#x2014;this time, of unfused helium in the middle shells as well as unfused hydrogen in the outer shells, returning it for a short time to the red giant stage.</li>

<h4 id="orgbc91ccf">Mass Loss from Red Giant Stars and the Formation of Planetary Nebulae</h4>
<ul>
<li>As stars expand prior- and post-helium flash, they become very large, so that it's easier for outer particles to escape their gravity.</li>
<li>Stars lose a lot of gas this way, in expanding shells corresponding to the changing radius of the star as it contracts with its nuclear exhaustion, expands with the helium flash, contracts again with nuclear exhaustion (of He), etc.</li>
<li>Each shell can contain 10-20% of the star's mass.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>How many times will a star, having exhausted its fuel, spark a new fuel source?  Only once (helium) for these low-mass stars.</li>
<li>The star instead continues to compress, reaching surface temperatures as high as 100,000 K.</li>
<li>At this stage, the stars emit strong UV-radiation and stellar winds which heat up the gases they emitted in their red giant stage and ionize them, causing them to glow.</li>
<li>The result are misnamed, <i>planetary nebulae</i>, a name that has stuck.  Obviously, there are no planets involved here.</li>

<ul>
<li>4.5 billion years ago, the Sun just reached the zero-age main sequence and emitted only about 70% of its present radiation (Earth is theorized to have had more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, keeping it warm enough to match evolution).</li>
<li>As the Sun warmed, CO<sub>2</sub> was more readily absorbed in the hotter Earth into rocks and other reactions, decreasing its presence in the atmosphere, resulting in more stable climate.  This will continue in the future (but on way too slow a timescale to undo likely global warming effects of the next century).</li>
