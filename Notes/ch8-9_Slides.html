<ul>
<li>With a diameter of 12,756, how can we study Earth's innards?</li>
<li>One way is to by measuring the transmission of <i>seismic waves</i>, sound waves that travel inside the Earth due to, eg, earthquakes or explosions.  Just like a bell rings differently based on its shape and material distribution, the seismic waves change as they go through Earth.</li>
<li>Seismic waves are measured at various locations, which has determined an inner composition for the Earth.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <i>crust</i> is the outermost layer, covered 55% by water by 6 km thick <i>oceanic crust</i>, made typically of <i>basalt</i>, volcanic rock produced from cooled lava, while 45% is 20-70 km-deep continental crust, made typically of <i>granites</i>, a class of silicates made from silicon and oxygen.  .3% of Earth's mass.</li>
<li>The <i>mantle</i> is the largest layer, going down to about 2900 km.  It's pretty solid, though at these pressures/temperatures rocks can slowly move and deform.  Density of 2.5-5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</li>
<li>The <i>core</i> is dense and metallic with a diameter of 7000 km, larger than Mercury.  The <i>outer core</i> is liquid, and the <i>inner core</i> (2400 km in diameter) may be solid.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<ul>
<li>Evidence for differentiation is that the Earth's bulk density is 5.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup> while its surface density is only 3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</li>

</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org413f969">
<h4 id="org413f969">Magnetic Field and Magnetosphere</h4>
<ul>
<li>Moving ions in Earth's core create a giant magnetic field so that the Earth acts like a bar magnet; the region where this field dominates the Sun's magnetic field is called the <i>magnetosphere</i>, whose outer limit is the <i>magnetopause</i>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Charged particles moving in space become trapped in this magnetic field; namely, the <i>solar wind</i>, a collection of charged particles spreading outwards from the Sun's activities.  This shapes the magnetic field of the Earth away from the Sun.</li>
<li>High-energy ions are trapped in regions of the magnetosphere called the <i>Van Allen Belt</i>.</li>

<section id="slide-sec-orgb8138a7">
<h4 id="orgb8138a7">Composition of the Crust</h4>
<ul>
<li>Largely oceanic basalt and continental granite (as discussed), both <i>igneous rock</i> (cooled <i>lava</i>, or molten rock).</li>
<li><i>Sedimentary rocks</i> are wind or water-deposited rock fragments that bind together without melting, such as sandstone, shales, and limestone.</li>
<li><i>Metamorphic rocks</i> are igneous rocks changed by high temperature and pressure.</li>
<li>Neither sedimentary nor metamorphic rocks are common on other planets!</li>
<li><i>Primitive rock</i> is the material of the planetary system that hasn't undergone heating&#x2014;there's none from Earth itself, since Earth was in a molten state.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-orgfab2c02">
<h4 id="orgfab2c02">Plate Tectonics</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Geology</i> is the study of the Earth's crust and the causes of its shape.</li>
<li><i>Plate tectonics</i> explains the slow drift of continents and large geological features; it's a fundamental theory describing the heat transport of the Earth.  A heat transport mechanism is created in the evolution of all planets, based in part on the planet's composition.</li>
<li>From the crust outwards, Earth is divided into about a dozen tectonic plates which are moving, slowly.</li>
<li>The plate movement is powered by <i>convection</i>, or heat transfer by the movement of cold and hot material, of the mantle.  Convection mixes the milk in your coffee! <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmQ57IQFLCl/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet">https://www.instagram.com/p/BmQ57IQFLCl/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet</a></li>

<h4 id="org2715eab">Rift and Subduction Zones</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tectonic activity manifests in the crust as <i>rift zones</i> where tectonic plates pull apart from each other, with molten rock filling the space.</li>
<li>Most rift zones are now in oceans, the central African rift is an example of a continental rift zone.</li>
<li>As two plates drift apart, the plates overlap with other plates in <i>subduction zones</i>, most common with thinnner, oceanic plates.</li>
<li>This is how mountain ranges are formed, while the ragged peak shapes of mountains is from water/ice erosion (unlike on Mercury or the moon, which lack water).</li>
<li>60 thousand km of active rifts identified, drifting apart at 4 cm/year.</li>

<h4 id="org6eb9f51">Fault Zones and Mountain Building</h4>
<ul>
<li>Plates also slide parallel to each other in <i>faults</i>, also at a rate of centimeters per year.</li>
<li>Motion is not smooth, but builds up stress in the crust released in sudden slippage (earthquakes).</li>
<li>The average motion of the tectonic plates is constant, so the longer the time between earthquakes, the more violent the earthquake.</li>
<li>Eg, Parkfield, CA has slipped 1 m every 25 years or so, but LA has earthquakes for 7 m of slippage every 150 years.  The last time LA had an earthquake was 1857.</li>

<li>Stratosphere has ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) on top, which absorbs ultraviolet light so we can survive.  We were destroying ozone with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), causing a hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic, so an international agreement bans these chemicals.</li>

<li>This composition has changed during Earth's history, as studied, e.g., in the chemistry of minerals forming at different times.</li>
<li>Theories for source of Earth's atmosphere and oceans:
<ol>
<li>Formed with the rest of Earth from Sun debris.</li>

<li><i>Climate</i> refers to atmospheric effects that last decades and centuries, which accumulate.</li>
<li>A change in 2&deg; C would cut wheat production in half in North America, or melt enough glaciers to raise sea level by 10 m, flooding many cities and islands!</li>

<h4 id="org5ec5fd2">The Evolution of the Atmosphere</h4>
<ul>
<li>Key evolutionary step is blue-green algae which takes in CO<sub>2</sub> and releases oxygen; these gave rise to plants!  Plants make use of <i>photosynthesis</i>, taking advantage of sunlight energy for their internal growth.</li>
<li>Still not a lot of oxygen until 2 billion years ago due to Earth's crust's chemical reactions.</li>
<li>After that, oxygen formed Earth's ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) layer, which allowed life to leave the ocean (before this, landmass was barren of life).</li>
<li>Plants create oxygen which allows for animal life.  Animals ate plants.  Eventually, breathed oxygen directly from atmosphere.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Moon has no atmosphere, so that ancient happenings are preserved, and the Moon is deficient volatiles.</li>
<li>The Moon and Mercury share many similarities; see Table 9.1.</li>
<li>Both are geologically dead.</li>

<h4 id="org42b754c">Exploration of the Moon</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lunar exploration began with telescopic observations.</li>
<li>Russia took photos of the lunar far side in 1959 with Luna 3 and landed on its surface in 1966, transmitting pictures and data to Earth.</li>
<li>The US Apollo program sent 12 astronauts to the lunar surface from 1968 to 1972; the first arrived in 1969.  The program achieved three major objectives:
<ol>
<li>Astronauts collected 400 kg of samples for analysis.</li>
<li>Each landing after the first left a lunar surface experiment package (ALSEP).</li>
<li>Orbiting Apollo command modules analyzed lunar surface from above.</li>

</ol></li>
<li>Lunar missions lasted until 1972.</li>

<h4 id="org4739d06">Composition and Structure of the Moon</h4>
<ul>
<li>Density of only 3.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, the Moon is made entirely of silicate rock.  No large metal core (measured with seismometers).  Little water on Moon in chemically bound form, in rocks.</li>
<li>NASA crashed LCROSS (lunar crater observation and sensing satellite) into Moon's South pole at 9000 km/hr, releasing a plume of water vapor and other chemicals visible o other spacecrafts.</li>
<li>Estimated total water on Moon is hundreds of billions of tons; only enough to fill a lake 100 miles across.</li>
<li>Estimated to be from asteroids and comets, some small fraction of their water froze in extremely cold regions (<i>cold traps</i>).</li>

<ul>
<li>Lunar rocks were radioactively dated to be up to 3.3-4.4 billion years old, much older than Earth's.  Keep in mind Earth and the Moon were created 4.5-4.6 billion years ago.</li>
<li>Moon crust is made of 83% silicate rocks called <i>anorthosites</i>, in regions known as the lunar highlands, which are 4.1-4.4 billion years old.</li>
<li>The maria cover 17% and are much less cratered, consisting mostly of dark-colored basalt from volcanic eruptions billions of years ago which covered <i>impact basins</i> of colliding material.</li>
<li>Major lunar volcanic activity ceased about 3.3 billion years ago.</li>

<li>"The surface is fine and powdery. I can pick it up loosely with my toe. But I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine sandy particles." - Neil Armstrong</li>
<li>Boots sank several centimeters into fine dust of upper surface of lunar maria.</li>

<h4 id="org46d5193">Volcanic Versus Impact Origin of Craters</h4>
<ul>
<li>Astronomers didn't realize lunar craters were result of impacts&#x2014;citing rarity of impact craters on Earth&#x2014;and thought they were the result of volcanic activity.</li>
<li>Grove Gilbert, a geologist, suggested they were formed from impacts.</li>
<li>Turns out the impacts are circular because of the minimum speed that gravity gives them and their resulting symmetric explosions, but Gilbert's theory wasn't accepted until after WWI when such explosion craters were studied to be circular.</li>

<h4 id="org7254317">The Cratering Process</h4>
<ol>
<li>Projectile penetrates 2-3 times its diameter into planet, will form 10-15 times its diameter of a crater.</li>
<li>Resulting shockwave spread into planet with heat equivalent to nuclear bomb.</li>
<li><i>Ejecta</i> are thrown out of the crater, which fall like an <i>ejecta blanket</i> to fill the crater.</li>
<li>Higher speed ejecta travel farther and can leave their own <i>secondary craters</i>.</li>

<h4 id="org89e2e13">Using Crater Counts</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recall that we can age planets using craters to see when the last smoothing activity took place.</li>
<li>Can make inferences about craters based on craters on lunar maria or current number of projectiles (asteroids and comets)&#x2014;eg, for the Moon, a 1 km crater should be produced on average every 200 millenia, a 10 km crater every few million years, and one or two 100 km craters every billion years.</li>
<li>This results in an estimate of several billion years for the craters in the maria, which matches Moon rock sample radioactive dating.</li>
<li>Comparing crater rates on highlands and maria on the Moon tells us that comets formations took place at a much higher rate before 3.8 billion years ago: highlands are 4.2 billions years old but have 10 times as many craters.</li>

<ul>
<li>Earlier hypotheses for Moon origin:
<ol>
<li>Fission Theory: Moon was part of Earth but separated early on.</li>
<li>Sister Theory: Moon formed together (but independently of Earth.</li>
<li>Capture Theory: Moon formed elsewhere and was captured by Earth.</li>

</ol></li>
<li>Do they hold up?
<ol>
<li>No - Modern calculations show this sort of splitting to be impossible, and some chemical differences unexplained.</li>
<li>Maybe.</li>
<li>No - No way for the Moon to slow down enough after entering Solar System to orbit Earth, and the orbit would be more eccentric, and their compositions are too similar.</li>

<li><b>Giant Impact Hypothesis</b>: An Mars-sized object hit Earth, nearly breaking the planet apart, creating a dust cloud that condensed into the Moon&#x2014;there is increasing evidence of projectiles of planetary mass in inner Solar System during terrestrial planet formation.</li>
<li>This explains the Moon's compositional similarity to Earth and its lack of metal, as well as the loss of volatile elements.</li>
