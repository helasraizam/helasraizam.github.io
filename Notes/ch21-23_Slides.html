<ul>
<li>Stars are defined by their ability to sustain nuclear fusion.</li>
<li>Stable (main-sequence) stars like the Sun maintain equilibrium through nuclear fusion in their stars.</li>
<li>Each second, 600 million tons of hydrogen fuse to helium in the Sun, releasing 4 million tons of matter as energy.  This means all stars will eventually run out of fuel.</li>
<li>Stars range from about 1/12 M<sub>o</sub> to 200 M<sub>Sun</sub>, with smaller stars being more prevalent.</li>

</ul>

<li>Along the main sequence, the higher the mass, the higher the luminosity.</li>

<ul>
<li>To study star birth, we have to look for dense, cold clouds.</li>
<li><i>Giant molecular clouds</i> are massive reservoirs of interstellar matter, with temperatures 10-20 K and most atoms bound in molecules.  Most stars are born of giant molecular clouds.</li>
<li>Clouds contain cold, dense regions called <i>clumps</i>.  Clumps in turn somtimes contain denser, smaller regions, called <i>cores</i>, which are star embryos!</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Remember that a star's life revolves around two forces, gravity and pressure&#x2014;gravity condenses everything inward, and pressure resists by pushing out.</li>
<li>The higher the temperature, the higher the pressure.  So low-temperature clouds and cores are ideal for gravity to take over, which is good, because&#x2026;</li>
<li>To sustain fusion, we need to increase the density of interstellar atoms by 10<sup>20</sup>.</li>

<li>Once star clusters mature, they can help create more clusters, which is how the stars of Orion are theorized to have come about.  This process is referred to as <i>triggered star formation</i>.
<ol>
<li>A massive star emits UV and high-speed gas (stellar wind) when formed.</li>

<ul>
<li>The step between dust compressing and the youngest star is difficult to observe, because (1) it's very short (thousands of years, making it sparse), and (2) it's literally as dusty as you can get without being a star, so that it absorbs a lot of visible light.</li>
<li>Still, a combination of limited observations and theoretical calculations yield the following.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ol>
<li>A dense, cold core is formed.</li>
<li>The gravitational force of infalling gas overwhelms the (relatively low) internal pressure.</li>
<li>A rapid collapse ensues, increasing many-fold the core density.  Between this core contraction and the beginning of pp-fusion, the object is called a <i>protostar</i>.</li>
<li>By conservation of angular momentum, the protostar spins faster and faster as it contracts, so that objects along the poles (which don't move much) collapse inward, but objects along the equator don't quite collapse.</li>
<li>The protostar, having reached its final mass, becomes a <i>T Tauri star</i>.</li>

<ul>
<li>We can graphically describe the evolution of a star by tracing its characteristics in an H-R diagram!</li>
<li>Let's start with a protostar, which is initially cool with a very large radius and low density.  Heat can radiate out of the star easily at this low-density stage, meaning gravity is much stronger than internal pressure.</li>
<li>Thus the star very quickly shrinks, decreasing its surface area and therefore luminosity (downward on H-R diagram).</li>
<li>It keeps shrinking until internal temperature is strong enough to counter gravitational contraction, increasing its temperature in the process (leftward on H-R diagram).</li>

<li>When the star's inner temperature is high enough to fuse hydrogen to helium, we say the star has reached the main sequence.</li>
<li>Stars on the main sequence are much more stable, changing very slowly with the depletion of hydrogen, the star's life fuel.</li>
<li>Where the star falls on the main sequence depends on its mass; the higher the mass, the higher the temperature and luminosity.</li>
<li>If the mass is too low (less than the <i>critical mass</i> of 0.075 M<sub>o</sub>), temperatures for nuclear reaction are never achieved; these become brown dwarfs or planets.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if the mass is too high (100-200 M<sub>o</sub>), the internal pressure halts the accretion of additional matter.</li>

<ul>
<li>While on main sequence, mass doesn't change much (only .7% of mass is converted to energy in fusion) but chemical composition goes from mostly Hydrogen to more and more Helium.</li>
<li>This change in composition changes the star's temperature, luminosity, size, and interior structure.</li>
<li>This moves it along the H-R diagram!  How?</li>
<li>As H converts to He through the nuclear pp-chain, the inner density increases, increasing temperature, giving protons more speed on average, resulting in more collisions, and a much higher rate of fusion.</li>
<li>The rate of fusion of the pp-cycle increases with temperature as</li>

</ul>
<p>
\[\mbox{Rate of pp-fusion}\propto{}T^4.\]
</p>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>So temperature increases, and luminosity will increase due to the increased rate of fusion (which produces increased rate of energy).</li>
<li>This means up and to the left on the H-R diagram, but these changes are relatively small and most stars remains on the main sequence for most of their lives.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org3ca4a74">
<h4 id="org3ca4a74">Lifetimes on the Main Sequence</h4>
<ul>
<li>How long a star stays on the main sequence depends on how much fuel it starts with and how quickly it uses it up.</li>
<li>More massive stars use up fuel more quickly since they need greater inner temperatures to balance out the much higher pressures of outer layers, and the rate of fusion goes as T<sup>4</sup>.</li>
<li>On average, 90% of a star's life is spent on the main sequence.  This time depends on its mass.</li>
<li>Turns out a mass of .4 gives the star around 200 billion years on the main sequence, while a mass of 40 solar masses is a mere million years (Table 22.1).</li>

<h4 id="org775102a">From Main-Sequence to Red Giant</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eventually, hydrogen in the core is depleted with helium in its place (and whatever heavier elements it had to start with).</li>
<li>The temperature for helium fusion is much higher, so that doesn't happen in these stars.</li>
<li>The star begins to shrink, and its brightness and heat comes from the conversion of gravitational into heat energy (as Kelvin and Helmholtz posited).</li>
<li>This process heats up the hydrogen that was just outside the core the whole time enough for it to undergo fusion, which in turns heats up layers outside of it, causing them to expand.</li>
<li>Meanwhile the helium core keeps contracting, giving out more heat, causing more fusion.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Most star burns brighter than it ever did in this stage, since the fusion is not confined to the core.</li>
<li>The increased heat causes the outer layers to expand, and the star's size increases ridiculously.</li>
<li>This increase in size results in a decrease in temperature.  So our star is now cooler (to the right H-R) but also more luminous (up on H-R).</li>
<li>As stars evolve, they become more red.</li>
