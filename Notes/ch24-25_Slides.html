<ul>
<li>We can use stellar surveys to analyze the formation of the Galaxy.</li>
<li>For example, since the oldest stars in the halo and globular clusters are spherically distributed, the <i>protogalactic cloud</i> that birthed the Galaxy was probably roughly spherical.</li>
<li>The oldest stars are 12-13 billion years old, so our Galaxy probably shares about that age.</li>
<li>Just as with star formation, the protogalactic cloud collapsed to form a thin rotating disk.</li>
<li>Stars born before the collapse didn't participate in it!</li>

<li>70 kLy from Earth and 50 kLy from the Galactic center is the closest known galaxy, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.</li>
<li>It's on the other side of the galactic center, and its elongated shape indicates it's being torn by our galaxy's tides.</li>

<li>There's evidence for more close encounters between our Galaxy and others.</li>
<li>Such interactions with smaller galaxies result in the Milky Way stealing some of their stars due to its greater pull, which then orbit our Galaxy in eccentric halo orbits.</li>
<li>Astronomers have identified streams originating from 12 small galaxies that came close to our galaxy, with six more streams associated with globular clusters.</li>
<li>Globular cluster M54 is thought to be the nucleus of the Sagittarius dwarf which is currently merging with the Milky Way.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>There are more galactic collisions in store.  Long tidal tails have been stripped from the Canis Major dwarf galaxy and wrapped themselves around the Milky Way thrice; they are expected to merge in the next billion years.</li>
<li>In 3 billion years, the Milky Way itself is expected to be swallowed by the Andromeda galaxy.</li>
