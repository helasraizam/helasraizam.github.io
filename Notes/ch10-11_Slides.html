<li>Venus and Mars are geologically alive like Earth, and unlike Mercury and the Moon.</li>
<li>Mars and Venus are among the brightest night sky objects.</li>
<li>Venus' orbit is 3/4 as wide as Earth's, Mars' orbit is 1.5 times as wide.</li>
<li>Venus comes closer to Earth (40 million km) than any other planet.</li>

<li>Can see from Earth at resolution of 100 km (no topographic features, but see ice caps!).</li>
<li>Giovanni Schiparelli described "canale" (channels; long straight features) mistranslated as canals, leading to misunderstandings of intelligent life.  Larger telescopes clarified there are no canals; the brain tends to see patterns in noise.</li>

<li>Mars tilts by 25&deg;, also close to Earth, and shares similar seasons.  Year is twice as long as Earth's, however.</li>

<li>What's a day on Venus like with the retrograde rotation?  A Venus year is 225 Earth days, a Venus day is 243 Earth days&#x2014;the day is longer than the year!  Time for Sun to return to its position in Venus' sky is 117 Earth Days.</li>

<li>Half of the 50 spacecraft were successful.  Venera 7 was the first probe to land on its surface in 1970, and operated for 23 minutes because of the high temperatures.  Several Venera craft followed.</li>
<li>For a global surface study, need to resort to radar (due to dense clouds).</li>
<li>1970s, US Pioneer creates the first global radar map, improved in 1980s by Soviet Venera 15 and 16.  <i>Magellan</i> produced <i>100 m</i>-resolution images using an <i>imaging radar</i> to map Venus!</li>

<ul>
<li>No water or ice on Venus, slow wind speeds, so no erosion of features caused by volcanic eruptions and impact craters.</li>
<li>No evidence of subduction zones or plate tectonics in Venus' history despite convection in its mantle.</li>
<li>75% of surface is lava plains, which is not due to tectonics but formed like the Moon through lava eruptions.</li>

<li>Venus has a crater larger than Chicxulub: Mead, at 275 km, but no craters larger than the lunar impact basins.</li>
<li>Craters less than 1 km in diameter burn up in Venus' atmosphere, and those up to 3 km break in the atmosphere and cause distorted craters, but we can ignore atmospheric shielding if we only analyze craters 30 km and larger in diameter, caused by projectiles greater than 3 km in diameter.</li>
<li>Oldest large craters are 300-600 million years old, evidence of geological activity.</li>

<h4 id="org44e6235">Surface Temperature on Venus</h4>
<ul>
<li>Venus' surface of 700 K is much hotter than you'd expect from the sunlight that reaches it due to greenhouse effects.  The effect is concentrated in Venus, which has nearly a million times more CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>It's possible Venus once had a climate similar to Earth's, with water oceans and its CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in the ocean or rocks.  Even a little additional heating could result to increased evaporation of water and gas release from rocks, triggering the greenhouse effect, which in turn triggers more evaporation, in a situation termed the <i>runaway greenhouse effect</i>.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Once water evaporates, UV rays from the Sun can split it into hydrogen and oxygen atoms, the former can escape, and the latter combine with rocks, in a process that is very difficult to reverse.  There's evidence that this is what happened to the water once present on Venus.</li>

<li>Outer solar system is <i>reducing</i>, meaning that elements tend to combine with hydrogen first.</li>
<li>That means oxygen tends to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O) before it forms things like methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) or ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>).</li>
<li>This is why giant planet compositions are mostly hydrogen-based gases.</li>

<li>Eight spacecraft (7 from U.S., one from Europe) have penetrated beyond asteroid belt into outer solar system.</li>
<li>Flight times are years&#x2013;decades (months for inner solar system).</li>
<li>Hours of delay for spacecraft to communicate to Earth and be fixed!</li>
<li>Sun is too far away to provide spacecraft with enough energy.</li>

<li>1972-3: Pioneer 10 and 11: "Can we get past the asteroid field and survive Jupiter's <i>magnetosphere</i> (region of magnetic influence)?  Pioneer 11 gravity assists to Saturn.</li>
<li>1977: Voyager 1 and 2: cameras, spectrometers, magnetosphere measurement devices.  Voyager 1 flew to Saturn and Voyager 2 to all the outer planets; Jupiter (1980), Saturn (1981), Uranus (1986), and Neptune (1989) in "Grand Tour" made possible by once in 175-year alignment of giant planets!</li>
<li>Earth to Neptune is 4.8 billion km.  Voyager 2's signals at Earth were weaker than the power it takes to operate a digital watch (10<sup>-16</sup> W), and was collected by 38 different antennas on four continents!</li>

<ul>
<li>The spacecraft discussed so far conducted flyby missions (it is what it sounds like).</li>
<li>Galileo, Cassini, and Juno are <i>orbiting</i> spacecraft!</li>
<li>Galileo launched 1989, arrived 1995.  It deployed a probe onto Jupiter, whose massive gravity accelerated it to 50 km/s (enough speed to cross continental US in under 2 minutes) and heated its heat shield to 15,000 &deg;C.  The probe took data as it descended 200 km into the atmosphere for an hour, two hours later Galileo fired retro-rockets to be captured in Jupiter's orbit, to study Jupiter's moons.</li>

<li>Cassini (U.S. and Europe) launched 1997 and arrived in Saturn's orbit in 2004 to study its rings and moons, deploying an entry probe in 2005 into Titan, which landed on the surface!</li>
<li>Juno arrived at Jupiter in July 2016 to study the magnetosphere with an eccentric orbit from 4,000 km above clouds to 76,000 km.</li>

<li>Can't tell much about spin period from optical data, but can from radio data from its magnetic field!</li>
<li>Jupiter has period of 9h56, shorter than any other planet!  Saturn's period is 10h40, and Uranus and Neptune have about 17h spin periods.</li>
<li>Earth and Mars had seasons because of the tilt of their spin.  Do Jovian planets have seasons?
<ul>
<li>Jupiter is tilted by only 3&deg;, so no observable seasons.</li>
<li>Saturn is tilted 27&deg;, so it does experience seasons.</li>
<li>Neptune has tilt of 29&deg;, so it has seasons (slower than Neptune).</li>

<ul>
<li>Jupiter and Saturn theorized to be composed of hydrogen and helium.</li>
<li>Difficult to discuss inner composition since such pressures are unavailable on Earth.</li>
<li>Hydrogen becomes a liquid due to pressures inside Jupiter and Saturn, and deeper still becomes a metal, which it never does on Earth.  Most of Jupiter's interior is liquid metallic hydrogen.</li>
<li>Most of Saturn's interior is liquid.</li>
<li>Uranus and Neptune don't liquefy hydrogen as they are too small.</li>

<h4 id="org31b01ee">Internal Heat Sources</h4>
<ul>
<li>Collapse of material into their core during formation caused the planets to heat up considerably.</li>
<li>Jupiter had the most heat (why?).</li>
<li>Giant planets could still be generating heat with slow contracting.</li>
<li>Internal heat sources result in the planet having more heat than it would have from the Sun alone.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Jupiter has the largest internal energy source, 4&times;10<sup>7</sup> W, about the same as what it absorbs from the Sun!  This makes its atmosphere something between a star's (fully internal energy) and a planet's (nearly all energy from Sun).  Mostly primordeal heat.</li>
<li>Saturn has half this much internal energy, producing twice as much energy/kg as Jupiter&#x2014;how?  Still differentiating; helium is still sinking towards the core, releasing gravitational energy.</li>
<li>Neptune has a small internal energy source, Uranus has none, and they have about the same temperature.  Unclear why they have different internal heat.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org044203a">
<h4 id="org044203a">Magnetic Fields</h4>
<ul>
<li>Giant planets have a strong magnetic field and magnetospheres millions of kilometers wide.</li>
<li>Jupiter emits radio waves more intense at higher frequencies, the opposite of what is expected by thermal radiation alone.  This turns out to be <i>synchrotron radiation</i>, radiation emitted by electrons when they are accelerated.  Comes from Jupiter's "Van Allen belt", which is many times its diameter.</li>

<li>CH<sub>4</sub> (methane) and NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia) have been observed in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn by spectroscopic analysis of the reflected sunlight.  The more abundant hydrogen and helium were not detected until they were measured by a spacecraft (Voyager) because their spectra don't have easily detected features in the optical range.</li>
