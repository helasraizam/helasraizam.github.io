<h3 id="org2aa3de8">Telescopes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only about 9000 stars visible to human eye.</li>
<li>A <i>telescope</i> is a "bucket" for catching more light than your pupils normally would.</li>
<li>Size matters.</li>
<li>Light from the telescope can be spectrally separated.</li>
<li>Then the amount of light is detected by a <i>detector</i>, a sensor.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="org36d65e7">How Telescopes Work</h4>
<ul>
<li>A telescope <i>collects</i> light from a source, and <i>focuses</i> it into a point or image.</li>
<li>Collecting can be done with a lens or curved mirror.</li>
<li>Telescope light-gathering power is compared with <i>apertures</i>; diameters of the telescope opening.</li>
<li>How much more light can a telescope with twice the aperture collect?</li>
<li>Can use an additional lens, the <i>eyepiece</i>, to magnify the image.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="org075cd27">Lenses</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lenses are typically curved glass that <i>refract</i>, or bend, light rays.  This example converges light towards the <i>focus</i> of the lens, a <i>focal length</i> away from its center.</li>

</ul>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./Images/6_4.png" alt="6_4.png" />
</p>
</div>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li><i>Refracting telescopes</i> use a lens to focus light, while <i>reflecting telescopes</i> use a mirror.</li>

</ul>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./Images/6_5.png" alt="6_5.png" />
</p>
</div>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Light travels through a lens in refracting telescopes; imperfections anywhere in the lens or in the cut cause distortions.</li>
<li>Different frequencies travel differently in lenses (remember prisms?), leading to <i>chromatic aberration</i> in refracting telescopes.</li>
<li>Glass sags!</li>
<li>Reflecting telescopes avoid these problems with a concave <i>primary mirror</i>, for which only a single surface needs good manufacturing.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="orgd167567">Telescopes Today</h3>
<ul>
<li>Millions/billions of dollars to build.</li>
<li>Motorized drives.</li>
<li>Huge steel supports for heavy mirrors (around 15 tons!).</li>
<li>Largest diameter 10.4 m.</li>
<li>Correct mechanically for sag (among other things).</li>
<li>Can use multiple mirrors together, like 36 hexagonal mirrors in Keck telescopes.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="org771fa32">Picking the Best Observing Sites</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gemini and Keck telescopes cost $100 million, so we want prime real estate.</li>
<li>Mountains, far from light pollution is good.</li>
<li>Other factors include clear weather, atmospheric water vapor, air turbulence  (which leads to bad <i>seeing</i>).  We want low turbulence, stable air (like air that's flowed over water a long distance).</li>
<li>So we want high, dark, and dry.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="org47f7f88">The Resolution of a Telescope</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resolution refers to precision of detail in an image.</li>
<li>Resolution measured in arcseconds (how big a quarter would look, 5 km away!).</li>
<li>Good resolution can come from high aperture.</li>
<li>Resolution is weakened by gases of different temperature which act as lenses, distorting the image.  This is why the stars "twinkle"!</li>
<li>It's also why we have telescopes on satellites in space.</li>
<li>Another option is <i>adaptive optics</i>, where we undistort atmospheric distortion with a flexible mirror.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orge421225">Visible-Light Detectors and Instruments</h3>
<ul>
<li>The human eye has short <i>integration time</i>; the time to accumulate light energy before sending a signal (to the brain).  A fraction of a second.  Also, the brain doesn't have a usb cable to save our data, so we use detectors.</li>
<li>Before the detector, we typically use a spectrometer.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="orgdecfef8">Photographic and Electronic Detectors</h4>
<ul>
<li>Used to take photographs, now use <i>charge-coupled devices (CCDs)</i> like those in cellphone cameras, where light radiation is measured in a grid of <i>pixels</i>.  This is 90 times more sensitive to light than the old photograph method.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="org2fda401">Infrared Observations</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/infrared_gallery/1">Infrared Zoo</a></li>
<li>These are difficult because at an average surface temperature of 300 K, the Earth emits radiation at a peak wavelength of 10&mu;m (Wien's Law).</li>
<li>Detectors are shielded from nearby radiation and cooled near absolute zero (1-3 K) through immersion in liquid Helium.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="org73c57ef">Spectroscopy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gives information about chemical composition, temperature, motion, and more.</li>
<li>Spread out light by color (using prism or more commonly, a <i>grating</i>) and put detectors in each color's path to measure just that color.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="org5f55037">Radio Telescopes</h3>
<ul>
<li>1930s, Karl G. Jansky measures radio signals from an unknown source, strongest about 4 minutes earlier on each successive day.  What does he conclude?</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="org0343e6a">Detection of Radio Energy from Space</h4>
<ul>
<li>Note: radio waves are not Ke$ha's latest hits, they categorize a band of waves 10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>12</sup> Hz.  We can't hear/see radio waves.</li>
<li>Moving charged particles can create waves, so can waves move charged particles!</li>
<li>How to create a radio wave-mirror?  Radio waves are reflected by conducting surfaces.  Radio telescopes resemble giant satellite dishes.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="orgfd284c2">Radio Interferometry</h4>
<ul>
<li>Longer wavelengths are harder to resolve; the largest radio telescope has lower resolution than an amateur telescope.</li>
<li>Radio astronomers take advantage of <i>interference</i> in radio waves by linking two or more telescopes into an <i>interferometer</i>, or better yet, into an <i>interferometer array</i>, such as the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, NM, consisting of 27 25-m aperture telescopes on railroads over 36 km.</li>

<h4 id="org3728b3e">Radar Astronomy</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Radar</i> is bouncing radio waves off of objects in our solar system and analyzing the reflection.  Timing gives us the distance to, say, a mountain on Jupiter's surface.</li>
<li>Using the Doppler effect, radar observations can determine the speed of objects!</li>
<li>Best facility was 305-m telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in a bowl shape with hills, wherein the detector is moved.  Now surpassed by Five-hundred-meter Aperture Radio Telescope (FAST) in Pingtang Cty, China, which moves plates in the dish to focus on different objects.</li>

<li>Largest planets Jupiter and Saturn close to Sun in composition.  Heavier elements sink to rocky, metal, ice center, bulk is liquefied hydrogen.</li>

<li>Terrestrial planets also have denser matter in center of planet, leading to theory that they were once also liquid.  Process of separating a planet's interior layers into different compositions and densities is called <i>differentiation</i>, which occurs when the planet is hot (melting point of rocks, ~1300K), and stays as the planet cools.</li>

<h4 id="org5ad53ba">Temperature: Going to Extremes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remember the light intensity falls as \(1/r^2\); this light also provides heat.  The temperature reduces approximately as \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}\), so the farther you are from the Sun, the colder it gets.  Mercury (.39 AU from the Sun) is about 500 K, while Pluto (39.5 AU from the Sun) is 50 K.</li>
<li>Remember, planetary atmosphere has a big effect on this; heat kept in by <i>greenhouse effect</i>; in which atmosphere has greater transparency to (incoming) visible radiation than (outgoing) infrared.  The effect results in Venus having greater temperature than Mercury!</li>
<li>Earth is the only planet we know of with surface temperature generally matching liquid phase of water.</li>

<li>Internal forces can build mountains and build new islands; eg, volcanoes, earthquakes.  Earth and Venus are most active planets, and even some jovian planet moons are active!  The Moon has been dead and inactive for billions of years.</li>
<li>Hawai'i's getting a new island by 32,018!  (maybe)</li>

<ul>
<li>Planets orbit the Sun (and, mostly, themselves) counter-clockwise, and the Sun orbits itself counter-clockwise, evidence that the Sun and planets may have formed from a spinning cloud of gas and dust called the <i>solar nebula</i>.</li>
<li>Sun, Jupiter and Saturn have similar compositions, evidence they may have been formed from the same material reservoir.</li>

<h4 id="orge7bb75f">The Evidence from Far Away</h4>
<ul>
<li>We can compare this present data to star systems far away that are in varying stages of formations like that of the solar system to get a good picture of the birth of the solar system.</li>
<li>The name for solar nebulas (the cloud posited to birth the solar system) outside of the solar system is <i>circumstellar disks</i>.</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-sec-">
<h4 id="org17f3a37">Building Planets</h4>
<ul>
<li>As planets form from circumstellar disks common around young stars, we begin to see <i>planetesimals</i>&#x2014;planet foetuses.  Computer simulations with Physics laws taken into account support these theories.</li>
<li>Still leaves the questions; why do Uranus and Pluto spin on their sides, why does Venus spin slowly around itself retroactively?  These could be the results of early collisions.</li>

<li>Charged particles moving in space become trapped in this magnetic field; namely, the <i>solar wind</i>, a collection of charged particles spreading outwards from the Sun's activities.  This shapes the magnetic field of the Earth away from the Sun.</li>
<li>High-energy ions are trapped in regions of the magnetosphere called the <i>Van Allen Belt</i>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Largely oceanic basalt and continental granite (as discussed), both <i>igneous rock</i> (cooled <i>lava</i>, or molten rock).</li>
<li><i>Sedimentary rocks</i> are wind or water-deposited rock fragments that bind together without melting, such as sandstone, shales, and limestone.</li>
<li><i>Metamorphic rocks</i> are igneous rocks changed by high temperature and pressure.</li>
<li>Neither sedimentary nor metamorphic rocks are common on other planets!</li>
<li><i>Primitive rock</i> is the material of the planetary system that hasn't undergone heating&#x2014;there's none from Earth itself, since Earth was in a molten state.</li>

<h4 id="org83a09c5">Plate Tectonics</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Geology</i> is the study of the Earth's crust and the causes of its shape.</li>
<li><i>Plate tectonics</i> explains the slow drift of continents and large geological features; it's a fundamental theory describing the heat transport of the Earth.  A heat transport mechanism is created in the evolution of all planets, based in part on the planet's composition.</li>
<li>From the crust outwards, Earth is divided into about a dozen tectonic plates which are moving, slowly.</li>
<li>The plate movement is powered by <i>convection</i>, or heat transfer by the movement of cold and hot material, of the mantle.  Convection mixes the milk in your coffee! <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmQ57IQFLCl/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet">https://www.instagram.com/p/BmQ57IQFLCl/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet</a></li>
