<ul>
<li>The Sun, like the rest of the stars in the Galaxy, orbits the Galactic center.</li>

<ul>
<li>We obtain the result that the mass inside the Sun's orbit (a radius of 30,000 Ly) is about a billion Solar masses.</li>

<li>By comparing the period of the Sun to that of the matter outside of the Galaxy, we can find how much matter is between the Sun's orbital radius and the edge of the Galaxy.</li>

<li>For <b>spiral galaxies</b>, we can observe the rate of rotation of a galaxy through its redshift.</li>
<li>This rate can then deduce the galaxy's mass through Kepler's Law.</li>
<li>We then add the dark matter beyond the galaxy's visible edge by analyzing its satellites, such as stars, star clusters and satellite galaxies.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>This method is not effective with <b>elliptical galaxies</b>, in which stars don't rotate together like in the spiral galaxies.</li>
<li>Instead, we have to measure the various speeds of these stars and use the fact that the galaxy isn't breaking apart.</li>
<li>We do this by measuring the Doppler broadening caused by some stars moving towards us and some stars moving away, which simultaneously redshift <i>and</i> blueshift our measurements.</li>

<h4 id="org77b5316">Mass-to-Light Ratio</h4>
<ul>
<li>Galaxies can be characterized by the ratio of their mass (in units of M<sub>Sun</sub>) to their light output (in units of L<sub>Sun</sub>).</li>
<li>This <i>mass-to-light ratio</i> reveals what kinds of stars make up most of the galaxy and whether it contains a lot of dark matter.</li>
<li>For example, a high mass-to-light ratio of 10-20 implies older stars which have completed their evolution and ceased to shine, while galaxies still undergoing star formation range a ratio of 1-10.</li>
<li>Galaxies containing dark matter can have ratios as high as 100.</li>

<ul>
<li>Remember that cepheids divulge their luminosity in their periods of luminosity.</li>
<li>Fun fact: Walter Baade showed that there were actually two kinds of cepheids in the early 1950s, resulting in calculated distances to all galaxies being doubled!</li>
<li>While cepheids can help us locate stars up to 108 MLy away, the difficulty is that the telescope has to be good enough to see a single cepheid.</li>
<li>Beyond a certain distance, we need an alternative method.</li>

<h4 id="orgd310f87">Standard Bulbs</h4>
<ul>
<li>To measure distances, astronomers seeks <i>standard bulbs</i>; objects with the same intrinsic brightness.</li>
<li>One particularly useful standard bulb is the <i>type Ia supernova</i> which we've discussed are the result of a white star's explosion in a binary system.</li>
<li>At maximum light, they all reach about 4.9&times;10<sup>9</sup> L<sub>Sun</sub>.</li>
<li>Supernovae are extremely bright explosions, so they can be observed from much further away, and have been measured up to 8 GLy away!</li>
<li>Hence Type Ia supernovae are the most important standard bulbs when it comes to far distances.</li>

<h4 id="org70a864c">Other Measurement Techniques</h4>
<ul>
<li>Brent Tully and Richard Fisher found another technique for measuring galactic distances by observing that the luminosity of a spiral galaxy is related to its rotational velocity!</li>
<li>This makes sense; the more massive the galaxy, the faster objects in its outer regions orbit it.</li>
<li>So if mass-to-light ratios for various spiral galaxies are similar, we can estimate their luminosity from their mass, which we get from their rotational velocity!</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>In practice, Tully and Fisher observed the normally thin 21-cm line of cold hydrogen to measure Doppler broadening, from which they calculated the range of orbital velocities of the hydrogen gas.</li>
<li>Observations of nearby galaxies show that this method works well, despite not accounting for dark matter.</li>

<h4 id="org0273f2c">Slipher's Pioneering Observations</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 1894, wealthy astronomer Percival Lowell established a Flagstaff, AZ observatory and asked one of the observatory's young astronomers, Vesto M. Slipher, to photograph spectra of spiral nebulae for spectral lines corresponding to newly forming planets.</li>
<li>Despite technological hardships (the unsuitable telescope needed to be exposed 20-40 hours for a good spectrum), Slipher managed to to photograph 40 spiral nebulae from 1912-1932.</li>
<li>He found an unexpected redshift in the spectra that showed the spirals were moving away at tremendous speeds up to 1800 km/s!</li>
<li>Only close-by galaxies turned out to be approaching us, the rest were all racing away!</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Meanwhile, Hubble was observing galaxies with the largest then telescope (2.5 m, or 100 inches), with Milton Humason.</li>
<li>Hubble found that the recession velocities of the galaxies were proportional to how far away they were; the farther a galaxy is from us, the faster it was moving away.</li>
<li>The constant of proportionality is called the <i>Hubble constant</i> H<sub>o</sub>, and is included in <i>Hubble's Law</i>,</li>

</ul>
<p>
\[v=H_{o}d\]
where v is the velocity of the galaxy and d how far away it is!

<li>H<sub>o</sub>&asymp;22 km/s/MLy</li>

<h4 id="org7e1176b">Hubble's Law and Distances</h4>
<ul>
<li>Why does this law make any sense?</li>
<li>Not only does the Hubble constant describe the redshift of galaxies based on how far they are, but it can help us find distances to galaxies based on the observed redshift!</li>
<li>However, this result is only valid if the Hubble constant has always been constant&#x2014;if it hasn't, we'll notice it in far galaxies.</li>
<li>And we did&#x2014;as we'll discuss regarding the Big Bang, it turns out the expansion of the universe is <i>accelerating</i> with time!  This needs to be taken into account to get distances to galaxies; especially for galaxies farther away.</li>

<li>Unlike these models, the universe has no boundaries, edge, or center.</li>
<li>However, the models accurately portray that neither the ants nor the raisins are themselves actively moving away; it's the space they're in that's stretching out.</li>
<li>Also, neither the ants nor the raisins themselves are expanding, and this is also the case of galaxies in space.</li>
