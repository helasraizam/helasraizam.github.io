<li>In 1785, William Herschel noticed that most of the stars he observed lay along a plane.</li>
<li>He hypothesized that the Sun was near the middle of a disk-shaped system of stars.</li>
<li>The shape was correct, but he thought we were at the center because of interstellar dust.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Sun, like the rest of the stars in the Galaxy, orbits the Galactic center.</li>
<li>The speed of this orbit is 200 kps (!), so that it takes us 225 million years to circle the galactic center.  This is called a <i>galactic year</i>, of which 20 have passed in Earth's entire lifetime.</li>
<li>We can use this orbital period and Kepler's law to find the mass of the galaxy.</li>

<ul>
<li>We obtain the result that the mass inside the Sun's orbit (a radius of 30,000 Ly) is about a billion Solar masses.</li>

<ul>
<li>By comparing the period of the Sun to that of the matter outside of the Galaxy, we can find how much matter is between the Sun's orbital radius and the edge of the Galaxy.</li>
<li>Remember, we can use Kepler's Law here because the orbits are <i>stable</i>; neither falling into the galactic center, nor flying out away from it.</li>
<li>Astronomers calculate the total mass of the Galaxy to be at least 2&times;10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>Sun</sub>!</li>

<ul>
<li>Can't be black holes or neutron stars, which would produce more X-rays than are observed, and would have resulted in a lot more heavy elements in younger stars than we observe today.</li>

<ul>
<li>During WWII, Walter Baade of Germany discovered two types of stars using the Mt Wilson telescopes of Southern California.</li>
<li>Examining Andromeda, he noticed that the reddish stars in its nuclear bulge resemble those in our globular clusters and halo, and distinguished these from the bluer stars near the spiral arms.</li>

<li>We now know these have different chemical compositions, age, and orbital motions around the galactic center.</li>
<li>Population I stars are found only in the disk and with eccentricities near zero, such as supergiants.  Interstellar matter and molecular clouds are found where Population I stars are found.</li>
<li>Population II stars don't care about spiral arms, but occur throughout the galaxy, with eccentric elliptical orbits that can take them through the galactic disk.  These include RR Lyrae.  Stars in globular clusters are also classified as Population II.</li>
<li>Population I has stars as old as 10 billion years and as new as today, while Population II consist of ancient stars 11-13 billion years old.</li>
