<h4 id="orgf437c51">The Giant Planets</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recall there are the rocky terrestrial planets and icy jovian planets&#x2014;they must have formed under different conditions.</li>
<li>Largest planets Jupiter and Saturn close to Sun in composition.  Heavier elements sink to rocky, metal, ice center, bulk is liquefied hydrogen.</li>
<li>Uranus and Neptune also have a core of rock/metal/ice, but smaller atmospheres.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org788199e">
<h4 id="org788199e">The Terrestrial Planets</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most abundant rocks are <i>silicates</i>, made of silicon and oxygen, and most common metal is iron.  Mercury has the greatest proportion of metal, the other 3 have similar composition of 2/3 silicates and 1/3 iron-nickel/sulfur combinations.</li>
<li>Terrestrial planets also have denser matter in center of planet, leading to theory that they were once also liquid.  Process of separating a planet's interior layers into different compositions and densities is called <i>differentiation</i>, which occurs when the planet is hot (melting point of rocks, ~1300K), and stays as the planet cools.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org375bfad">
<h4 id="org375bfad">Moons, Asteroids, and Comets</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most moons share the composition of their planet (rocky for terrestrial moons and icy with a hard core for giant planets' moons)</li>
<li>Only the largest asteroids are differentiated.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org7dfe9ec">
<h4 id="org7dfe9ec">Temperature: Going to Extremes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remember the light intensity falls as \(1/r^2\); this light also provides heat.  The temperature reduces approximately as \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}\), so the farther you are from the Sun, the colder it gets.  Mercury (.39 AU from the Sun) is about 500 K, while Pluto (39.5 AU from the Sun) is 50 K.</li>
<li>Remember, planetary atmosphere has a big effect on this; heat kept in by <i>greenhouse effect</i>; in which atmosphere has greater transparency to (incoming) visible radiation than (outgoing) infrared.  The effect results in Venus having greater temperature than Mercury!</li>
<li>Earth is the only planet we know of with surface temperature generally matching liquid phase of water.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org86b41f4">
<h4 id="org86b41f4">Geological Activity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Planets shaped in part by comet collisions&#x2014;mostly during solar system formation, but even now; eg., Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter, Summer 1994, which came within 660 million km.</li>
<li>Internal forces can build mountains and build new islands; eg, volcanoes, earthquakes.  Earth and Venus are most active planets, and even some jovian planet moons are active!  The Moon has been dead and inactive for billions of years.</li>
<li>Hawai'i's getting a new island by 32,018!  (maybe)</li>
<li>Earth and Venus have molten cores.</li>

<ul>
<li>Rate of impact has been pretty constant for several billion years.</li>

<h4 id="org5b86502">Radioactive Rocks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some <i>radioactive</i> nuclei are unstable and can split apart (decay) to other nuclei, at random times.</li>
<li>But we do know their <i>half-life</i>; the time for approximately half of them to decay in a large sample.</li>
<li>The original unstable nuclei are the <i>parents</i> and they split apart to <i>daughter</i> particles.</li>
<li>Every half-life, half of the particles will have decayed; this is the principle behind Carbon dating!</li>

<h3 id="org735eb8b">Origin of the Solar System</h3>
<ul>
<li>An <i>exoplanet</i> is a planet outside of the solar system.  Some of these range between the terrestrial and giant planets in size; termed <i>superearths</i>.</li>
<li>In some exoplanet systems, the giants are close to the star and the terrestrial planets are farther (to be discussed in ch 21)!</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-orge4813fe">
<h4 id="orge4813fe">Looking for Patterns</h4>
<ul>
<li>Planets orbit the Sun (and, mostly, themselves) counter-clockwise, and the Sun orbits itself counter-clockwise, evidence that the Sun and planets may have formed from a spinning cloud of gas and dust called the <i>solar nebula</i>.</li>
<li>Sun, Jupiter and Saturn have similar compositions, evidence they may have been formed from the same material reservoir.</li>
<li>Terrestrial planets have less of these materials, since at their temperature so close to the Sun the materials would evaporate (whereas they're liquid/ice/gas in the vicinity of the giant planets).</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org7ef9dd2">
<h4 id="org7ef9dd2">The Evidence from Far Away</h4>
<ul>
<li>We can compare this present data to star systems far away that are in varying stages of formations like that of the solar system to get a good picture of the birth of the solar system.</li>
<li>The name for solar nebulas (the cloud posited to birth the solar system) outside of the solar system is <i>circumstellar disks</i>.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-org77e0eb8">
<h4 id="org77e0eb8">Building Planets</h4>
<ul>
<li>As planets form from circumstellar disks common around young stars, we begin to see <i>planetesimals</i>&#x2014;planet foetuses.  Computer simulations with Physics laws taken into account support these theories.</li>
<li>Still leaves the questions; why do Uranus and Pluto spin on their sides, why does Venus spin slowly around itself retroactively?  These could be the results of early collisions.</li>

<h4 id="orgf37fae9">Earth's Interior</h4>
<ul>
<li>With a diameter of 12,756, how can we study Earth's innards?</li>
<li>One way is to by measuring the transmission of <i>seismic waves</i>, sound waves that travel inside the Earth due to, eg, earthquakes or explosions.  Just like a bell rings differently based on its shape and material distribution, the seismic waves change as they go through Earth.</li>
<li>Seismic waves are measured at various locations, which has determined an inner composition for the Earth.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <i>crust</i> is the outermost layer, covered 55% by water by 6 km thick <i>oceanic crust</i>, made typically of <i>basalt</i>, volcanic rock produced from cooled lava, while 45% is 20-70 km-deep continental crust, made typically of <i>granites</i>, a class of silicates made from silicon and oxygen.  .3% of Earth's mass.</li>
<li>The <i>mantle</i> is the largest layer, going down to about 2900 km.  It's pretty solid, though at these pressures/temperatures rocks can slowly move and deform.  Density of 2.5-5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</li>
<li>The <i>core</i> is dense and metallic with a diameter of 7000 km, larger than Mercury.  The <i>outer core</i> is liquid, and the <i>inner core</i> (2400 km in diameter) may be solid.</li>

<section id="slide-sec-orga286a9a">
<h4 id="orga286a9a">Magnetic Field and Magnetosphere</h4>
<ul>
<li>Moving ions in Earth's core create a giant magnetic field so that the Earth acts like a bar magnet; the region where this field dominates the Sun's magnetic field is called the <i>magnetosphere</i>, whose outer limit is the <i>magnetopause</i>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Charged particles moving in space become trapped in this magnetic field; namely, the <i>solar wind</i>, a collection of charged particles spreading outwards from the Sun's activities.  This shapes the magnetic field of the Earth away from the Sun.</li>
<li>High-energy ions are trapped in regions of the magnetosphere called the <i>Van Allen Belt</i>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Largely oceanic basalt and continental granite (as discussed), both <i>igneous rock</i> (cooled <i>lava</i>, or molten rock).</li>
<li><i>Sedimentary rocks</i> are wind or water-deposited rock fragments that bind together without melting, such as sandstone, shales, and limestone.</li>
<li><i>Metamorphic rocks</i> are igneous rocks changed by high temperature and pressure.</li>
<li>Neither sedimentary nor metamorphic rocks are common on other planets!</li>
<li><i>Primitive rock</i> is the material of the planetary system that hasn't undergone heating&#x2014;there's none from Earth itself, since Earth was in a molten state.</li>

<h4 id="orgd531fa7">Plate Tectonics</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Geology</i> is the study of the Earth's crust and the causes of its shape.</li>
<li><i>Plate tectonics</i> explains the slow drift of continents and large geological features; it's a fundamental theory describing the heat transport of the Earth.  A heat transport mechanism is created in the evolution of all planets, based in part on the planet's composition.</li>
<li>From the crust outwards, Earth is divided into about a dozen tectonic plates which are moving, slowly.</li>
<li>The plate movement is powered by <i>convection</i>, or heat transfer by the movement of cold and hot material, of the mantle.  Convection mixes the milk in your coffee! <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmQ57IQFLCl/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet">https://www.instagram.com/p/BmQ57IQFLCl/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet</a></li>
