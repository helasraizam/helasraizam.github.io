<ul>
<li>Lunar exploration began with telescopic observations.</li>
<li>Russia took photos of the lunar far side in 1959 with Luna 3 and landed on its surface in 1966, transmitting pictures and data to Earth.</li>
<li>The US Apollo program sent 12 astronauts to the lunar surface from 1968 to 1972; the first arrived in 1969.  The program achieved three major objectives:
<ol>
<li>Astronauts collected 400 kg of samples for analysis.</li>
<li>Each landing after the first left a lunar surface experiment package (ALSEP).</li>
<li>Orbiting Apollo command modules analyzed lunar surface from above.</li>

<ul>
<li>Density of only 3.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, the Moon is made entirely of silicate rock.  No large metal core (measured with seismometers).  Little water on Moon in chemically bound form, in rocks.</li>
<li>NASA crashed LCROSS (lunar crater observation and sensing satellite) into Moon's South pole at 9000 km/hr, releasing a plume of water vapor and other chemicals visible o other spacecrafts.</li>
<li>Estimated total water on Moon is hundreds of billions of tons; only enough to fill a lake 100 miles across.</li>
<li>Estimated to be from asteroids and comets, some small fraction of their water froze in extremely cold regions (<i>cold traps</i>).</li>

<li>Moon crust is made of 83% silicate rocks called <i>anorthosites</i>, in regions known as the lunar highlands, which are 4.1-4.4 billion years old.</li>
<li>The maria cover 17% and are much less cratered, consisting mostly of dark-colored basalt from volcanic eruptions billions of years ago which covered <i>impact basins</i> of colliding material.</li>

<li>Grove Gilbert, a geologist, suggested they were formed from impacts.</li>
<li>Turns out the impacts are circular because of the minimum speed that gravity gives them and their resulting symmetric explosions, but Gilbert's theory wasn't accepted until after WWI when such explosion craters were studied to be circular.</li>

<h4 id="org0ff55ee">Using Crater Counts</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recall that we can age planets using craters to see when the last smoothing activity took place.</li>
<li>Can make inferences about craters based on craters on lunar maria or current number of projectiles (asteroids and comets)&#x2014;eg, for the Moon, a 1 km crater should be produced on average every 200 millenia, a 10 km crater every few million years, and one or two 100 km craters every billion years.</li>
<li>This results in an estimate of several billion years for the craters in the maria, which matches Moon rock sample radioactive dating.</li>
<li>Comparing crater rates on highlands and maria on the Moon tells us that comets formations took place at a much higher rate before 3.8 billion years ago: highlands are 4.2 billions years old but have 10 times as many craters.</li>

<li>No - Modern calculations show this sort of splitting to be impossible, and some chemical differences unexplained.</li>

<ul>
<li>Just over half Earth's diameter, with an average density of 3.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.  No global magnetic field, though surface magnetizations suggest a magnetic field billions of years ago, implying the present lack of conducting liquid material in its core.</li>
<li>Has continental highlands and widespread lowland volcanic plains like Venus, with a total range of 31 km.  Lowland plains look like the lunar maria.</li>
<li>Southern hemisphere is heavily cratered, northern is younger with plains 5 km lower, a geological division like Earth, the Moon, and Venus.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Near equator is a high continent the size of North America called the Tharsis bulge, atop which are four great volcanoes.</li>

<h4 id="org2909dcf">Volcanoes on Mars</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lowland Martian plains have same density of impact craters, implying they formed about the same time 3-4 billion years ago.</li>
<li>Largest Martian volcano is Olympus Mons (Mount Olympus), with a half-kilometer diameter and rising 20 km over the plains&#x2014;thrice the size of the tallest Earthly mountain, with a volume 100 times greater than Hawai'i's Mauna Loa.  The caldera alone is about the size of LA.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>Olympus Mons is only up to about 100 million years old since it has few impact craters, and so may still be active.</li>

<h4 id="org29bfd75">Martian Cracks and Canyons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Tharsis bulge results in tectonic cracking of the crust.  The Valles Marineris ("Mariner Valleys") are a large canyon extending about 5000 km (nearly a quarter around Mars!).  It's 7 km deep and 100 km wide, and the entire Grand Canyon could fit in one of its side canyons!</li>
<li>Valles Marineris weren't made by water, but by tectonic forces.</li>

<li>Most winds only a few kph, but Mars can have powerful planet-engulfing windstorms that cover the planet in wind-blown dust.</li>
